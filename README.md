# Project-HappyDestinations
HappyDestinations is an application which can help users to find all the information about their upcoming holiday event in one place. They can sign up and write reviews on their recent holiday spot, communicate with other users to learn their experience about the holiday place and much more. This is a side project which I am working on right now. I initially developed this application while I was learning web development. Now I retook the responsibility to complete the application until it is fully functional and up running. Right now, It has the dynamic functionality and Authentication features implemented in it.
